# SimpleShell
It's self-explanatory.

It is a simple shell written in C. It executes commands and prints results. Currently it does not have | ; < << > >> because, you know... It's a simple shell. Simple.
Anyway, between 30Jan and 2Fev my 4g wifi ended, those bastards, and I only could upload the rest at 2Fev.

Enjoy. And If you are at Uni. feel free to use my content.
